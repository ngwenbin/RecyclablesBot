# Recyclables

Singapore's 1st Karung Guni hailing bot

Our goal is to improve Singaporeâ€™s domestic recycling efforts by partnering with the local karung guni community. By bridging the gap between residents and the collectors via a digital platform, household recycling is made more convenient and at the same time, it reduces recycling waste contamination which makes recycling overall more effective.
