# Recyclables

Singapore's 1st Karung Guni hailing bot

Our goal is to improve Singaporeâ€™s domestic recycling efforts by partnering with the local karung guni community. By bridging the gap between residents and the collectors via a digital platform, household recycling is made more convenient and at the same time, it reduces recycling waste contamination which makes recycling overall more effective.

## Misc

- For production deployment, we are using a webhook to listen for incoming messages. Local testings will use polling. Do take note before commiting.
```python
# For production deployment
updater.start_webhook(listen="0.0.0.0",
                      port=int(PORT),
                      url_path=TOKEN)
updater.bot.setWebhook("https://{}.herokuapp.com/{}".format(NAME, TOKEN))
```

- Updates to the bot must be done via pull request. ***Be careful of editing files in master branch!***

- To get your chatids, userids etc. For groupchat ids, you need to add the bot into the group and then send the /start command. No deployment required.

```python
  https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOURBOTTOKEN}/getUpdates/
```
