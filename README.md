# Recyclables

Singapore's 1st Karung Guni hailing bot

Our goal is to improve Singaporeâ€™s domestic recycling efforts by partnering with the local karung guni community. By bridging the gap between residents and the collectors via a digital platform, household recycling is made more convenient and at the same time, it reduces recycling waste contamination which makes recycling overall more effective.

## Requirements to install (Follow the order)

1. Clone repo

2. [Install Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/). You can either choose between mini conda or anaconda. It makes the dependencies installation much easier.

3. Create a Conda env with the provided yml file. Below are a few useful commands.

```python
  # To change the name of the env, edit the first line of the yml file before creating it. Deafult is recyclables
  conda env create -f environment.yml # Create new env with python installed
  conda info --envs # See list of conda envs
  conda activate recyclables # activate the env, if you changed the env name, kindly update env name accordingly.
```
4. Inside kgid.py, do not touch the kg_prod dict as it is for production use only. Update your grpchat ids in the else block:
```python
      else: # testing ids, always use this for personal tests.
        d = {
            "1" : CHATID,
            "2" : CHATID,
            "3" : CHATID,
            "4" : CHATID,
        }
```
5. Create your own .env file and paste your own Telegram bot token + API token inside. Do not touch anything else.:
```python
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = BOT_TOKEN
GROUPCHAT_ID = kgid_test
API_TOKEN = API_TOKEN
HEROKU_NAMES = recyclablesbotlocal
```


## Misc
- For unresolved dependencies, check the bottom left bar of vscode and ensure that you are using the correct python interpreter. It should say Python 3.x.x XX-bit {'YOUR_ENV_NAME':conda}
- For production deployment, we are using a webhook to listen for incoming messages. Local testings will use polling. Do take note before commiting.
```python
# For production deployment
updater.start_webhook(listen="0.0.0.0",
                      port=int(PORT),
                      url_path=TOKEN)
updater.bot.setWebhook("https://{}.herokuapp.com/{}".format(NAME, TOKEN))
```

- Always commit to dev-clean branch. ***Do not edit files in master branch without permission***

- To get your chatids, userids etc. For groupchat ids, you need to add the bot into the group, send a message in the group and use the following api request. No deployment required.

```python
  https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOURBOTTOKEN}/getUpdates/
```
