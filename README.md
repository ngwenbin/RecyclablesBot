# Recyclables

Singapore's 1st Karung Guni hailing bot

Our goal is to improve Singaporeâ€™s domestic recycling efforts by partnering with the local karung guni community. By bridging the gap between residents and the collectors via a digital platform, household recycling is made more convenient and at the same time, it reduces recycling waste contamination which makes recycling overall more effective.

## Requirements to install (Follow the order)

1. Clone repo and its submodules
```shell
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/ngwenbin/RecyclablesBot.git
```

2. Switch to dev branch
```shell
  git checkout dev-clean
```

3. Open terminal to create a python venv and install dependencies from req.txt.
Make sure you are running python 3.8.x

#### For Windows:
```shell
  python -m venv YOUR_ENV_NAME # Creates virtual env
  pip install -r req.txt # install packages from req.txt
  cd wheel_dependencies # navigates to binary wheel dir
  for %x in (*.whl) do python -m pip install %x # install binary wheels/ deps
```

#### For MacOS:

If the pip fails, please use conda with conda forge channel priority to install the packages.

-  With Pip:
```shell
    python -m venv YOUR_ENV_NAME # Creates virtual env
    pip install -r req.txt # install packages from req.txt
    pip install shapely fiona pyproj # Order is important
    pip install geopandas # Order is important
  ```

- With Conda

Install conda via miniconda or anaconda.

```shell
  conda create --name YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3.8 # Creates virtual env
  conda config --add channels conda-forge # sets dep channel
  conda config --set channel_priority strict
  pip install -r req.txt # install packages from req.txt
  conda install geopandas # Conda will install the necessary deps
```

4. Inside kgid.py, do not touch the kg_prod dict as it is for production use only. Update your grpchat ids in the else block:
```python
      else: # testing ids, always use this for personal tests.
        d = {
            "1" : CHATID,
            "2" : CHATID,
            "3" : CHATID,
            "4" : CHATID,
        }
```
5. Create your own .env file and paste your own Telegram bot token + API token inside. Do not touch anything else.:
```python
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = BOT_TOKEN
GROUPCHAT_ID = kgid_test
API_TOKEN = API_TOKEN
HEROKU_NAMES = recyclablesbotlocal
```


## Misc
- For unresolved dependencies, check the bottom left bar of vscode and ensure that you are in the correct environment. It should say Python 3.x.x XX-bit {'env'}. The python interpreter should be pointer at your env python at ENVNAME/Scripts/python.exe

- For production deployment, we are using a webhook to listen for incoming messages. Local testings will use polling. Do take note before commiting.
```python
# For production deployment
updater.start_webhook(listen="0.0.0.0",
                      port=int(PORT),
                      url_path=TOKEN)
updater.bot.setWebhook("https://{}.herokuapp.com/{}".format(NAME, TOKEN))
```

- Always commit to dev-clean branch. ***Do not edit files in master branch without permission***

- To get your chatids, userids etc. For groupchat ids, you need to add the bot into the group, send a message in the group and use the following api request. No deployment required.

```python
  https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOURBOTTOKEN}/getUpdates/
```
